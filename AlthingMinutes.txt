13 Aug 2022
Summary of Althing 08/13
Appeal for pockets (Levi Flannery)
Pockets spoke, admitting to and apologizing for his actions. He iterated that public drinking was decriminalized in Oregon, that this is an extreme punishment for a first offense, and that bruises sometimes happen in this game as we are a medium contact sport.
Opening the floor for people speaking for and against, Ellscry pointed out that drinking is in fact still illegal in public parks in the state of Oregon as well as the city of Dallas.
Farlanok stated that though this is a first time punishment that Pockets has been noted to play unsafely before and not been positively receptive to reeves asking him not to.
moving onto new business, Oso brought forth a motion on behalf of an anonymous member to remove the awards, titles, and knight's belts of Moonshine aka Marc Jacobs. He iterated that  the anonymous proposer had the following two points:
-Someone who is indefinitely suspended should not be a knight.
-In the future should he return to Blackspire he should not be able to return as a knight.
Oso then added that Moonshine is currently active in the kingdom of Winter's Edge, as that changes the context of the conversation from "someone who is likely never coming back" to "someone who is actively playing, carrying our highest honors, while indefinitely suspended from our kingdom". Oso stated he also already gained the permission of the monarch of winter's edge to remove these honors as dictated by the corpora.
Dee Metria asked if Moonshine's suspension propagated, monarchy clarified it did not.
There was no other new business, with the only old business being the elections themselves. Ballots were handed out directly after the court that followed the althing.

The election are closed!
I have spent time this morning counting and authenticating votes received and I mostly prewrote the post, so after doing my second count results are already available.
We had a total of 42 voters total, 24 physical and 18 remote, with no voters disqualified. Note that remote voters who hand wrote ballots and did not include specific votes in their ballot were counted as an abstain in those races.
For the office of Monarch vote totals are as follows:
Akryn (Lucas Fuller) - 6
Adge Aethren (Alvin Huber) - 2
Cat Viserion Tendragon (Catelyn Smith) -20
Farlanok Silvershield (Zack Kaufman) - 14
Abstain - 0
No confidence - 0
Congratulations to our new incoming queen Catelyn Smith 
For the office of Regent
Dagon Hellsfire (Logan Bledsoe) - 40
Abstain - 2
No confidence - 0
For the office of Champion
Lenalin (Jeremiah Lundstrom) - 41
Abstain- 1
No confidence - 0
For vacant BoD seats
Akryn 3
Dee Metria 3
Rion 3 
Falcon 1
Klar 1
As such, filling the three open seats of the BoD, should they accept their nominations, will be Lucas Fuller, Christen Marie, and Kaycii Lynn 
On suspension and probation of Pockets Levi Flanery
Uphold 27
Overturn 0
Abstain 15
As such, Pockets will continue to serve his one year suspension at the will of the althing.
Thank you for everyone that voted, I was receiving, tallying and verifying votes in real time until literally the last minute. It's heartening to see that so much of our membership put in the effort to vote remotely.
Finally, congratulations to our incoming Monarchy members Queen Cat Viserion Tendragon, Regent Dagon Hellsfire, and Champion Lenalin. Welcome to  the winter reign team, Bryan and I look forward to working with you for the first half.

Good evening populace of Black Spire. I come to bearing the results of the votes. I know many of you were on the edge of your seats waiting for the results. We had 39 votes total. I want to thank all of you who voted, I was pleased with this turn out. Now, if you did not specifically select "yes" or "no" your vote got counted as "Abstain" after running the numbers of those who did not select anything after voting for someone else, even if those had been "no" votes, the winners would not have changed.

Alright Black Spire here is your #bsalthing post from August 14th 2021.
We didn't have a video so here is a quick recap.
Theory started off the Althing by thanking everyone who came out. Rysa handed out physical awards for the things she's been giving awards to, throughout her A&S event.
Dragon Master was discussed, it will be at Dusk Hollow this weekend August 8/22/21. Entries must be in by 12:00pm. We're going to do our best to stick to this strict timing because Dragon Master traditionally pulls in more entries than other events and therefore takes longer to judge. There will be food. There will also be artisans taking commissions. We can't actually sell anything as that's against the park's rules however you can request a commission.
We also discussed Weaponmaster which will be held on 8/29/21. Big Mac has already posted about that, so I won't go into details on that. We will also be holding Elections that day. Please show up and vote. If you haven't gotten dues paid yet, please reach out to your local Chancellor. If you can't reach them, or you're having trouble, please let me know. Since Covid has flared up again and all, I will continue to take online votes, so you do NOT have to show up to vote. I will post a ballot online again, like I did for this last Althing.
That brings us to the Althing. Big Mac went over his proposal and then Akryn touched on his and then we ended the Althing so we could get on with the voting. Here are the results of that vote:
Proposal 1 allows Kingdom Regent to give out Warriors and Crowns.
16 Yes 1 No 2 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 2 allows Kingdom Champion to give our Smiths and Warriors
15 Yes 3 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 3 allows land Regents to give out Warriors and Crowns
17 Yes 1 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 4 allows land Champions to hand out Smiths and Warriors
15 Yes 3 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 5 allows allows Kingdom Regent to hand out Master Dragon, Garber, Lion, Owl, Rose, Smith, Warrior, Hydra and Reeve.
16 Yes 2 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 6 Big Mac's change to Weaponmaster
16 Yes 0 No 1 Abstain
Passes
(If you want details on what each of these changes looks like, please visit our files section)
As always, if you have any questions feel free to ask.
In service always,
Squire Overlord Falcon Moonsdotter your friendly neighborhood KPM

An Althing is held but results are not available on Facebook.
Ballot is posted as follows:

Althing Old Business. 2 items
Allthing proposal. #1
Research cost for NPO legal assistance.
Procedure: BoD President checks with no less than 3 NPO lawyers or legal firms to determine
cost for legal assistance in the Kingdom to operate as an NPO in Oregon/Washington.
Purpose: To ensure the Kingdom operates within legal requirements within Oregon and
Washington and the cost required to assist with legal standings.
The idea of this is to ensure our Corpora and operating procedures meet with both Oregon and
Washington law.
Reason for the BoD President to be directing this is because it deals with external agencies
which the Monarchy is not allowed to deal with unless approved by the BoD.
Yes______ (Yes this is something to look into)
No ______ (No this isn’t needed yet)
(Note: This is just for cost research and not an approval to hire a lawyer.)
Proposition for Allthing #2
Research and gather information about Microsoft 365 for use at the Kingdom level.
Action: BoD President, due to this being NPO related and dealing with the operation of the club,
uses the link attached to see if the Kingdom can benefit from and be given the program
Microsoft 365.
Reason: To assist in seamless transfer of positions and to reduce the loss of information
because of human.
Yes______ (Yes this is something to look into)
No ______ (No this isn’t needed)
(Note: This is just for cost research and not an approval to purchase.)
New Business (not being voted on)

maintaining of the social media pages.
1.6.7 Media Officer will assist the Kingdom Prime Minister in keeping files and documents
updated and organized. Archiving documents as needed.
1.6.8 Media officer will help and ensure all media, emails, and electronic documents are

1.6.9.1 This position does not have a time limit and does not need to be performed each reign.
1.6.9.2 An Election can be scheduled if there is a person(s) interested in performing the duty or

Opening discussion on a couple of items that were missed this weekend. 
Althing New Business.  2 items
Allthing proposal. #1
Research cost for NPO legal assistance.
Procedure:  BoD President checks with no less than 3 NPO lawyers or legal firms to determine cost for legal assistance in the Kingdom to operate as an NPO in Oregon/Washington.
Purpose: To ensure the Kingdom operates within legal requirements  within Oregon and Washington and the cost required to assist with legal standings.
The idea of this is to ensure our Corpora and operating procedures meet with both Oregon and Washington law.
Reason for the BoD President to be directing this is because it deals with external agencies which the Monarchy is not allowed to deal with unless approved by the BoD.
Proposition for Allthing #2
Research and gather information about Microsoft 365 for use at the Kingdom level.
Action:  BoD President, due to this being NPO  related and dealing with the operation of the club, uses the link attached to see if the Kingdom can benefit from and be given the program Microsoft 365.
Reason: To assist in seamless transfer of positions and to reduce the loss of information because of human.

7 Mar 2021
(proposal submitted by Aphaydren on Facebook)
Good Morning Blackspire! I would like to request the below propossl to be disscussed at the next Althing as per our copora.
Here is the "readers digest" of what the proposal would be. It would allow the land level reeves, that successfully pass a reeves test with 75% or better, be able to reeve at the kingdom level without additional kingdom level test.
This will allow the land level GMR's to have more of a role as a position within our game.
Without further ado here it is:
17.2 Reeve’s Guild
17.2.1 Members are those who have passed the Reeves test in the lands of the Black Spire within the last six months with a score of 75% or better.
17.2.2 Kingdom Guild Master of Reeves with agreement from either Kingdom Monarch or Kingdom Prime Minister has the right to veto membership of any Reeve who has demonstrated a lack of knowledge of the Rules of Play (hereafter referred to as ROP)
17.2.3 Any person whose membership has been revoked will still be allowed to take the next Reeves test and reenter the Guild.
17.2.4 Any person who has been removed from the Guild more than three times will have a short-term ban from the Guild of a minimum of one year, however, longer may be set by the Kingdom Guild Master and agreed upon by either the Kingdom Monarch or the Kingdom Prime Minister.
17.2.5 Reeves have the following powers over the battle games:
17.2.5.1May add newcomers and adjust the teams to balance a game.
17.2.5.2 May call whether a hit on a person is valid or not.
17.2.5.3 May take unsafe people or equipment off the battlefield.
17.2.5.4 May take time off a person's death if they died especially well.
17.2.5.5 May declare the end to a game if play is stagnating.
17.2.5.6 May appropriate additional reeves if they are needed. These reeves are temporary and not actual members of the guild, the guild reeve is still responsible for any calls this temporary reeve makes.
17.2.6 Reeves are responsible for the following:
17.2.6.1 Must ensure that the games are safe to participants and bystanders.
17.2.6.2 Shall help the participants in their understanding of the games.
17.2.6.3 Shall ensure that the quality of play is honest and in keeping with the spirit of the rules and corpora.


21 Feb 2021
Champion Election Correction
It has come to light that due to some miscommunication/misinformation that Lord Silverheart (Jason Gould) did in fact qual.    
He had indeed retaken the correct reeves test prior to the election, but it hadn’t been graded due to some mundane issues on the part of the GMR.  
Instead of making people recast their votes, i will hold a vote of confidence at the next Althing instead of opening up the pro-tem position as stated in the new business. 
Our apologies for any confusion to Lord Silverheart and the rest of the kingdom.   
Fodder and the rest of the monarchy team.

29 Jan 2021
(proposal submitted by Akryn on Facebook)
Updated proposal from my previous one. This is one connected proposal added the ability for the monarch to delegate the authority to award titles to the land level. This contains the previous change at the holder section of the constituion and adds:
2.3.1.1 Has the authority to delegate the awarding of noble titles to land holders as outlined under section 15.12.8 of this document.
This extra change is to satisfy the sections in the Rules of play under awards.
Each land level has different titles for service with excellence for each positions. for instance Duchy level Holders are given the title Baron for excellence, Barony level Holders are given Baronet, and Shire level Holders are given Lord.
This change is meant to help ensure everyone get's recognized by allowed more to be done at the local level instead of it all being done at the kingdom level. The holders are the ones that work directly with their teams and this would allow them to recognize their work directly. This is meant to be specifically for awarding the officers that served and not the general authority of granting the title Lord for service to the kingdom as per earlier portions of the constitution given to the monarch.
Attached is the format for the change.

Althing Proposal, James Hays, I assume this will be new business for the 17th then voted on at the following. Unsure how things are falling but it was an item I noticed that just needs to be tossed up.

1.4.5 If the Assistant Operations Officer assumes the position of pro-tem

the pro-tem Operations Officer may appoint a successor to the Assistant
Operations Officer position with approval of the general membership.

at the next general memebership meeting, this vote is not subject to

(Current office holders are ineligible for appointment.)
This is to clear up the "intended" vs "Stated" in the bylaws. The change is at the from 'with the approval of the general populace' which has no direct application and changes it to 'which will be ratified by general membership vote at the next general membership meeting....." Given the working so it does not have to be waited on for the new business clause.

Greetings Blackspire
I would like to propose an addition to the corpora for travel credits. 
I believe that extra credits will help incentivize people to visit different parks and play with new people more often than just KLEs.
I believe the more we all play together the better we can become a more cohesive kingdom.
Now

17.1.2 One(1) additional credit for attendings kingdom level event.

This should have been officially added to today’s agenda.       It was left off by mistake.   This will also be voted on at the next Althing.    
Our apologies
The monarchy.  
With the way discipline has been expanded to include things like probation, mutes, and removing from the kingdom page the wording of our corpora needs a bit of an update to reflect that and to ensure that the letter of the law better reflects the spirit.

(proposal submitted on Facebook by Akryn)
I know the Facebook live kingdom althing was last Sunday but there are a few things that need to be voted on that I would like added to the upcoming vote.

The cancellation of the Warmaster Tournament due to limited ability to attend parks and compete.


3 Jun 2020
Good afternoon everyone
As was discussed on the live Sunday there was some concern over the "no" vs "no confidence" used on the ballot during the election. Since that was the case as I said I reached out to all of the voters who cast ballots and had them recast with more expanded wording to ensure they understood the options. The options on the new ballot were as such.
1) I am for this person to take the office
2) I am against this person taking office(This means if the majority of votes are this way the candidate will not take the office)
3) I abstain from casting a vote on this
This was to ensure that everyone knew and understood the choice on the ballots and that they were making the choice they wanted to. The results came back as follows:
Heidi Russell Canary Voad Wormwood: 
12 Votes for, 1 Vote against, 0 Abstains
Nathan Axen, Davin:
10 for, 0 against, 2 abstain
Christopher Bowes, Jerago Brynjarrsen:
13 for, 0 against, 0 abstain
James Clements, Kitfox:
4 for, 9 against, 0 abstain
Thank you for your time and attention.


31 May 2020
An Althing was held online. Video was available and Ceian summarizes it as follows:
 Akryn was presenting as Monarch.
 Akryn explained the concept of "No Confidence" votes and explained that the PM election would be re-run with a clearer ballot.
 Kitfox proposes BOD minutes be posted to the kingdom group. Akryn replies that this is already being done.


26 Apr 2020
An Althing was held online. Video was available and Ceian summarizes it as follows:
 Akryn was presenting as Monarch.
 Akryn cites ORS 65.205 to support allowing for remote voting. (link: https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_65.205)
 Akryn states that per the BOD and per lack of any contradiction by the corpora, remote viewing should be allowable indefinitely (i.e. is not tied
  to the duration of the pandemic.)
 Akryn talks about a proposal for A&S judging guidelines submitted by Dragonbear. Endorses it, indicates it is new business scheduled to be voted on 
  at the next Althing.
 Akryn talks about a proposal by Fazadar that the Blackspire Facebook group become the "official line of communications" for the kingdom. Endorses it,

Moonshines(Marc Jacob) Proposals for Operation Bling
01/19/19
#1
Requesting funds of $500 for basic kingdom event materials and supplies. 
such as:
-2 plastic bins
-Med kits
-Walkie talkies 
-Supply's for gate (Sign in sheets, bracelets/wrist bands, clip boards, pens, paper, etc)
-Dragon master/ A&S Entry Forms 
-Award supplies. Need more copies of awards to be able to hand out at events.
These are the many basic items or supplies needed to help run the kingdom and campouts. I think it is time the kingdom starts actively investing in itself.
Yes: 5
No: 14
Abstain: 5
#2
On behalf of Operation Bling and our counted success and growth to promote the arts more with our courts, we are asking the kingdom to help fund some of our projects that is focused on our kingdom image.
We are asking for $150 to do this. It would include:
-Cloth for more table cloths in kingdom colors for high table
-Help contribute cost toward more kingdom banners.
Operation bling will also help fund money to help with this cause, but we will also need kingdom help.
Yes: 17
No: 3

Uriel’s proposed corpora changes
Event Changes
Policies Changes -
Proposal 1)
Change
11.4.9 All expenditures for the event will be paid for by check(s) made out to the specific business(es) for services, goods, and fees outlined in the event bid.
To
11.4.9 All expenditures for the event that can be paid for via check will be paid for by check(s) made out to the specific business(es) for services, goods, and fees outlined in the event bid. In addition to physical checks, this also allows for e-checks and invoices issued by the Treasurer through PayPal.
Yes: 24
No: 0
Abstain: 1
11.4.10 Additional expenses for the event such as supplies, feast, prizes, etc. that cannot be paid for via check will be handled by those funds being disbursed to the event runner. The event runner will need to sign a fiduciary contract for these funds, obligating them to be financially responsible for any funds that cannot be accounted for via receipts and change. This amount should never exceed the amount listed on the event runners bid and any changes need to follow procedure.
*The adding of this section would need to renumber subsequent sections to correctly format.
Reason: Last year both Pac War and Winterbash had to ask for funds. Many things are purchased via Amazon or at places that don’t take check such as Cash & Carry. The amended section 11.4.9 allows for us to pay for goods such as gate gifts and design work via PayPal for some needs. The new section 11.4.10 allows for what both events needed to do for prizes, incidentals, and feasts.
Yes: 24
No: 0
Abstain: 1
Proposal 2)
Change
11.5.2 A minimum balance of $3000 shall be maintained in the PacWar account.
To
11.5.2 A minimum balance of $4000 shall be maintained in the PacWar account.
Reason: Inflation and the fact this event routinely gets around 250 warrant an increase to the fun here of $1,000. The events profits the last two years should make adding an extra $1,000 possible. This would allow for a better event.
Yes: 23
No: 1
Abstain: 0
Proposal 3)
Change
11.5.4 The bidding process for PacWar will be open from the first day after the latest PacWar ends to Dec 1st of that same year. The group officers will review the bids and will announce their decision of who won the bidding process by Jan 1st of the next year.
To
11.5.4 The bidding process for PacWar will be open from August 1st and end on September 1st. The group officers will review the bids and will announce their decision of who won the bidding process by October 1st.
Reason: The current timeline makes it extremely difficult to secure many sites that would be available to us. Having 11 months to execute the event is more in line with what it takes to run an event of this scale. Changing the bidding to this would mean that all bids are in after the Monarchy who will decide them is elected. They would then have a month to review the bids and make sure one gets selected. This gives the winner a much longer window for putting together the event.
Yes: 21
No: 1
Abstain: 3
Proposal 4)
Change
11.6.2 A minimum balance of $2500 shall be maintained in the Winterbash account.
To
11.6.2 A minimum balance of $3500 shall be maintained in the Winterbash account.
Reason: So this was already increased but it didn’t seem to make it into the policies. That said it should be increased further. Running the event for $3,000 this year went alright, but knowing based on data we will get 150 means we need to increase the budget. Many sites will need more garbage coverage, we need more gate gifts, etc. The fun being at $3,500 would make it far easier to run an event for the amount of people with the increased days to 4.
Yes: 23
No: 1
Abstain: 1
Proposal 5)
Change
11.6.4 The bidding process for Winterbash will start on March 1st, 10 months prior to the Winterbash which is being bid on. Bids will be accepted from March 1 st through May 31st.
11.6.5 The winning bid will be announced no later than June 30th.
To
11.6.4 The bidding process for Winterbash will be open from March 1st and end on April 1st. The group officers will review the bids and will announce their decision of who won the bidding process by May 1st.
Reason: First it takes two sections and makes them one, and brings it inline with the formatting for Pac War. The main changes here are for the same reasons I proposed for Pac War. By having the bid due after elections, the monarchy voting on it will be in office. But this will give the event runners 8 months to execute their bid. I think this is important as it is hard to pull off the event with only a 6 month window.
Yes: 21
No: 2
Abstain: 2
Congratulations to all who ran and won. 
The copora changes will be added and fixed within the next week or two. Bank accounts will be put to the new amounts, and I will be sharing what they are now at at Coronation.

Good afternoon good people of Blackspire!
I apologize for not getting the results from the vote at the DF KLE about the status of The Mystic Seas.
So.......without further ado!
Votes went as follows:
12 Yes
2 No
1 abstain
Congratulations to all those who worked so hard to revive The Mystic Seas and make it an active and growing park. 
I will post the vote results from the BOD elections in the next few hours and also a full write up of what was brought up at the Allthing from Sir Moonshine. 
Thank you everyone for your patience,
Kingdom Prime Minister 
Puff Voad


19 Jan 2019
On Saturday during the Allthing, two proposals were brought up by Sir Moonshine (Marc Jacob). They are as follows:
01/19/19
#1
Requesting funds of $500 for basic kingdom event materials and supplies. 
such as:
-2 plastic bins
-Med kits
-Walkie talkies 
-Supply's for gate (Sign in sheets, bracelets/wrist bands, clip boards, pens, paper, etc)
-Dragon master/ A&S Entry Forms 
-Award supplies. Need more copies of awards to be able to hand out at events.
These are the many basic items or supplies needed to help run the kingdom and campouts. I think it is time the kingdom starts actively investing in itself.
#2
On behalf of Operation Bling and our counted success and growth to promote the arts more with our courts, we are asking the kingdom to help fund some of our projects that is focused on our kingdom image.
We are asking for $150 to do this. It would include:
-Cloth for more table cloths in kingdom colors for high table
-Help contribute cost toward more kingdom banners.
Operation bling will also help fund money to help with this cause, but we will also need kingdom help.


Awesome people of Blackspire, sorry for the delay in getting the results of the B.O.D. elections held at Winterbash.
I am pleased to welcome the following to the B.O.D. for the next year:
Chumley Scott - Alqamar
Brianna DeLacy - Kamerah Laedi
Jonás Pi Plup - Tezcatlipoca
Grant Hendrickson - Bambamm

Tez- 16
Akryn- 10
Kamerah Laedi- 18
Bahamut- 12

This player has the right to appeal this decision if they so choose, and the date of said appeal will be announced as soon as it is asked for.

With joint agreement between the Monarch and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Blackspire will be upholding this 3 month suspension on the player known as Lord Gannon.
As such, if Silvermoon repeals this suspension at their local appeal, We will, as well. (posted by the Queen)

Kingdom of Blackspire Prime Minister

My good people of Blackspire! I’m extremely sorry for the very delayed update on the amounts in all of the Kingdoms accounts. There were some scheduling and mundane complications that prevented me from having the amount of access I needed to the bank in order to do this. But everything is fixed and ready to go.
In the main account there is $5,376.28
In the Pacwar account there is $4,100
In the Winterbash account there is $3,000
I have spent $261.63 in total to reimburse for things needed and used in the Dallas Parade. Things such as decorations, gas for the truck and pizza for all who showed up.
I will also be officially announcing all this at the next KLE.
Your KPM
Puff Voad

Good evening Blackspire!
Sorry for the late post! But!!!!!!! I have the results from the allthing vote at the Forgotten Glades KLE this last Saturday August 4th.
The votes went as follows.
On the vote to release funds for;
Winterbash - 15 yes, 0 no, 2 abstain
Pac-War - 15 yes, 0 no, 2 abstain
Vote to uphold the Eries suspension- 11 yes, 4 no, 2 abstain
So in conclusion, the release of funds for both events passed, and will begin the process of having all parties involved sign fiduciary contracts and release the funds that were stated at the allthing. 
The vote on whether or not to uphold Eries(Bethany Love) 6 week suspension has passed and is still in place.
Thank you to all who participated in the events or even just watched. Always makes for a good KLE. Hope everyone had a good weekend and rest of your week. See you all August 19th at my home park Obsidian Grove for elections.
Your friendly KPM
Puff Voad ??

Greetings, Blackspire.
We would like to make a couple of announcements, here.
Firstly, the Kingdom will be upholding Silvermoon's suspension of the player known as Kalahan (Andrew Martin), citing a violation of the Amtgard Code of Conduct section 6. This player will be indefinitely barred from all Amtgard activities within the borders of Blackspire, effective immediately. This indefinite suspension will be repealed if/when Silvermoon repeals their suspension.
We would also like to announce the temporary suspension of the player known as Eries Evol (Bethany Love). This suspension is in response to their retaliatory behavior towards another player. With joint agreement between the Queen and the Prime Minister, this player will be barred from all Amtgard activities within the borders of Blackspire for six weeks, effective immediately. As this infraction occurred online, this player will also be muted from the Blackspire Facebook group for the duration of the suspension. This player has the right to an appeal, as do all suspended members of Blackspire. Should they request it, this appeal would take place at the next available althing, currently slated at Crown Quals on August 4th.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria Veleno of Blackspire

Dallas Parade
For consideration and discussion at the next althing, I request that the pacwar funds for 2018 be released directly to me as the event runner. This will allow me to purchase things online and better manage the event without the complication of getting the prime minister to write out business checks directly to the businesses. As many businesses do not accept business checks this greatly reduces the effectiveness of planning an event and restricts the items I can purchase for the event. I promise to have a ledger and keep all receipts to be turned over within 2 weeks after the event. And available for all monarchy request. Its to override 11.4.9 "All expenditures for the event will be paid for by check(s) made out to the specific business(es) for services, goods, and fees outlined in the event bid" of the policies document.
If there are any questions, Please ask.
In service,
Squire Klepto

So in conclusion, both lands have passed to be as named Defunct lands.
Thank you all who came to the KLE and participated in the parade, you guys did awesome and did Blackspire good.
Will be posting more on what happened at the althing later today or tomorrow, hope everyone has a good rest of your weekend.

Kingdom Prime Minister

Good morning people of Blackspire,
As of Saturday’s KLE at Iron Keep, the 6 month suspension of Maxamillion(David Zeller) stands and is still in place. With a vote of 8 yes and 1 abstain.
Kingdom Prime Minister 
Puff Voad


With agreement between the Queen and the Prime Minister, we are hereby suspending the player known as Celestia from all official Amtgard activities within the borders of the Kingdom of Blackspire for three months, effective immediately. This is in response to an incident that occurred at the inter-kingdom event Rosewood this weekend.
This player has the right to appeal the suspension, should she choose to do so, at which point all evidence will be brought to the next althing for the populace to vote on.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria Veleno of Blackspire


9 Jun 2018
With joint agreement between the Monarch, the Kingdom Prime Minister, and the Kingdom Guildmaster of Reeves, the player known as Maximilian (David Zeller) is hereby suspended from all Amtgard activity within the boundaries of the Kingdom of Blackspire for the next six months, effective immediately.
This action is being taken in response to both a formal report filed containing multiple statements about his behavior on the field and an incident at the kingdom sponsored event, Shattered Kingdoms, following him being asked to leave site.
We find him to be in violation of the Code of Conduct, sections 1, 5, and 6.
This player has the right to put in an althing proposal to defend himself and his actions and ask for the suspension to be repealed, and he may attend that althing in order to present his defense.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria Veleno of Blackspire

Proposals from Sir Uriel
1.Change Constitution: 
12.2.1 Any award or title may be rescinded by a 3/4 majority of vote of active members at an Althing. 
To:
12.2.1 Any award or title may be rescinded by a 2/3 majority vote at a group membership meeting.
12.2.1.1  Only active dues paid members may vote on rescinding an award or title.
Reason:
Fixes confusing verbiage about needed percentage being from those voting or those dues paid.  Reduces needed percentage to ? which is more inline with removing officers.


2. Change Constitution:
14.3.5 The tournament brackets will be: 
14.3.5.1 Single short weapon. 
14.3.5.2 Double short weapon. 
14.3.5.3 Shield and weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.3.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.3.5.5 Open (contestant's choice). 
To:

14.3.5.3 Shield and short weapon. 
14.3.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.3.5.5 Open (contestant's choice of melee weapons and shields).
Reason:
Standardizes tournament brackets other than great and open as short melee weapons.  Which is more inline with how we have run this tournament.


3. Change Constitution:
14.5.4 The Weaponmaster tournament will be a multi-bracketed, single elimination tournament. 14.5.5 The brackets must include: 
14.5.5.1 Single one-handed weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.5.5.2 Double weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.5.5.3 Shield and weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.5.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.5.5.5 Open (contestant's choice). 
14.5.6 At the Guildmaster of Reeves' discretion, the "Single one-handed weapon bracket" may be replaced by two separate "Single short weapon" and "Single long weapon" brackets. If this is not done, long weapons shall be allowed in the bracket. 
14.5.7 Other brackets may be included at the discretion of the Guildmaster of Reeves. Possibilities include:
14.5.7.1 Bow. 
14.5.7.2 Dagger (single or double). 
14.5.7.3 Flail. 
14.5.7.4 Thrown weapon.
14.5.8 Specific rules and bracket selection for the Weaponmaster Tourney must be posted at least two weeks prior to the date set forth for the Tournament.
To:
14.5.4 The Weaponmaster tournament will be a multi-bracketed, single elimination tournament. 
14.5.4.1 A different tournament format may be use at the discretion of the Guildmaster of Reeves.
14.5.5 The brackets must include:

14.5.5.3 Shield and short weapon. 
14.5.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.5.5.5 Open (contestant's choice of melee weapons and shields).

14.5.7.1 Single long weapon.
14.5.7.2 Archery.

14.5.7.4 Thrown weapon.
14.5.8 Specific rules and bracket selection for the Weaponmaster Tourney must be posted at least two weeks prior to the date set forth for the Tournament.
Reason:
Sets the standard to short melee weapon for brackets that are traditionally that on often set as that.  Allows tournament organizer more freedom with tournament style.

4. Change Constitution:
14.5 Weaponmaster Tournament 
14.5.1 Shall be held on the same day as elections for Monarch and Regent, or within the next two weeks of that date.
To:
14.5 Weaponmaster Tournament 
14.5.1 Shall be held once a reign either on the same day as elections for Monarch and Regent or the same day as elections for Prime Minister, or within the next two weeks of one of those dates.
Reason:
Allows the Monarch flexibility when building a schedule.  Still assures the Weapons Master is held but allows it to be held around midreign should that fit better with the reigns schedule.

To:
15.17.6.2 Holdings may hold their own versions of Warmaster, Weaponmaster, and Dragonmaster  tournaments but the winners of these events are not granted the title of Warmaster, Weaponmaster, or Dragonmater.

Proposal from Pungkow

On June 11, 2016 a proposal was voted in that would allow $500 from the profit of PacWar to be added to the PacWar account. Because there was no profit made from PacWar, inflation, and that bids for PacWar are requiring more funds for the site fee, it is proposed that $500.00 worth of general funds are allocated into the PacWar account for use. It also states in the policies that the account is supposed to have this amount ($2500.00). The current amount in the PacWar account is $2000.25.

11.5.2 A minimum balance of $2500 shall be maintained in the PacWar account. 

Voting:
Yes: A vote of yes for this proposal would transfer $500.00 from the general fund ($3128.43 balance) to the PacWar account ($2000.25 balance) to raise the minimum amount to $2500.00.

No: A vote of no for this proposal would keep the balance of the PacWar account the same.

Proposals from Ceian
1) The first is that I am bringing forward the proposal to change our corpora from the current version to the drafts the BOD has been working on for the past year and a half. Due to clauses in the event related sections of the corpora locking them down to require a 2/3 vote to edit, a proposal to change the corpora wholesale will also require a 2/3 majority vote to pass (since those sections would be changed).
This one is to replace the corpora with a rewrite that divides the document into three sections:
one that is our actual legally binding bylaws
one that is out-of-game mundane policies
one that covers game / roleplay based matters such as the awards system
This rewrite also adds a section explicitly detailing rules for how holdings should run in order to meet the kingdom's standards. They're pretty loose, were written to reflect reality, and shouldn't be telling you to do anything you weren't already doing. 
This is not a new corpora written from scratch. This is the existing Blackspire corpora, reorganized into three sections, with details on holding affairs added. There may be a few relatively minor changes here and there but overall the BOD's mandate on this project was NOT to give the kingdom a new, better corpora, it was partition the existing corpora into separate sections.
2) The second is that I am bringing forward a sub-proposal, should the corpora rewrite proposal not pass, to add a clause to the current corpora authorizing the Monarch to sign contracts and enter into legal agreements on behalf of the organization. Amtgard International will be asking us to sign a contract with them agreeing to their terms in exchange for use of the Amtgard name. Our current bylaws don't give any authorization to anyone to enter our organization into contracts
And one more piece of new Althing business. Corpora edit proposal (edit to the current corpora).
ADD:
1.199 Has the authority to sign contracts binding the group that have been approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors.
This gives the monarch the authority to sign contracts. I'm introducing it as a proposal at the same time as the corpora rewrite proposal just in case the corpora rewrite proposal fails. We (the kingdom) need to sign a new contract with Amtgard International. Our current bylaws don't give anyone the authority to do that. The rewritten bylaws do, but in case we don't adopt them, this proposal would patch the current bylaws so that that contract can be signed.
Sir Baelnorn’s proposal
3) Proposal: Allow Shattered Kingdoms to create its own legal NPO.
Yes Vote: Shattered Kingdoms would register with the state, retain its funds and legal rights to the world of Shattered Kingdoms.
No Vote: Shattered Kingdoms would release its funds to the kingdom’s general fund.
What would this mean? 
This would mean that Shattered Kingdoms would register as a non-profit business, just like Black Spire and retain funds from gate fees, auctions and fundraisers, all of which would be used to better Shattered Kingdoms events. Shattered Kingdoms would make financial information available upon request within a reasonable amount of time. We would also endeavor to make sure we continued to be sanctioned by an Amtgard group to continue to be an amtgard event.
Why keep it separate from Black Spire? 
Unlike Winterbash and PacWar Shattered Kingdoms has not been ran by Black Spire. Shattered Kingdoms is the creation of Josh Miller (Baelnorn), Brian Ogilvie (Vincent) and Kim Dietz (Kai Soulful) and is not a bid based system and there are no intentions of it ever being such. The creative and organizational control isn’t tied to Black Spire. Additionally there are intellectual concerns. The world of Shattered Kingdoms was never intended to be owned by Black Spire and I, Josh Miller, would like the rights to the world of Shattered Kingdoms to be tied to its own NPO. The fact that the event has been the kingdom’s mid-reign was an added bonus but is not the purpose for Shattered Kingdoms.

Blackspire althing proposal 6/11/16
Please fill in the bubble next to your vote.  If you are proxy voting on behalf of someone else, please fill in their information as well as yours in the space indicated below.


For the distribution of funds in regards to Pacific War: Armageddon (being held September 2016). We propose the following.

The first $2,000 made from the event will be used to replenish the Pac War fund, as currently is stated in the copora.

In the event that not enough is made by PacWar(gate entry sales, fundraisers) to fully repay Northern Lights and Black SPire contributions, the amount left will be split evenly between both groups.  In no situation will any Kingdom be owed money by PacWar, other than what the event itself brings in.

Any third parties who needed to put money in will be reimbursed.  In the event not enough proceeds are left after repayment of PacWar fund and the Kingdoms, this money is just a loss and will not be owed to any third parties.

All money left after reimbursement on the reimbursement schedule will be considered profit.

Profit will be divided as follows.

The first $500 profit will be allocated to the Pac War find.  In recognition of raising costs of reserving sites place the need of a fund to be enlarged.

All profit after that will be a split according to kingdom investment.

(Example 1 - If Blackspire and Northern Lights both invest $2000, remaining profits would be split 50/50).

(Example 2 - If Blackspire invested $2000 and Northern Lights invested $500, remaining profits would be split 80/20).

This constitutes distribution of profits based on investment.”

Let us continue to discuss but this current rework should satisfy the things I’ve seen brought up so far (enlarging Pac War fund, making sure Pac War fund is replenished first).

The Freehold Forest of Fado has requested to join The Kingdom of Blackspire.
Tyrant Ceian has requested $500 dollar for the express purpose of having the re-written copora looked at by a lawyer.  Any of the $500 not spent on this legal fee will be returned to the kingdom.

Sir Blade brought forward the point that as worded, the proposal leaves open the possibility for Northern Lights to indebt Blackspire if it contributes an amount large enough, and the event loses an amount of money large enough, that they can't be reimbursed from the gross. He requested additional safeguards be added against this in the proposal. Based on his commentary, Duke Kalzar tabled his proposal until the next Althing to be further rewritten.

Pacwar funding proposal by Sir Tseng and Duke Kalzar
For the distribution of funds occurring in regards to Pacific War: Armageddon (being held September 2016), we propose the following.

The first $2,000 made from the event will be used to replenish the Pac War fund, as currently is stated in the corpora.

Proceeds will then be split evenly until investments from both Black Spire (outside of the Pac War fund) and Northern Lights are recouped.

Following this any third parties who needed to put money in will be reimbursed.

All money left after reimbursements on the reimbursement schedule will be considered profit.

Profit will be divided as follows.

The first $500 profit will be allocated to the Pac War fund. In recognition of raising costs of reserving sites place the need of a fund to be enlarged.

All profits after that will be a split percentage according to kingdom investment.

(Example 1 - If Blackspire and Northern Lights both invest $2000, remaining profits would be split 50/50).

11.4 Termination and Suspension of Membership
11.41 Cause for Termination or Suspension - Any member can have their membership terminated or suspended for to and including the following: a) Conviction in a court of law for violation of State or Federal laws. (Note that not all convictions warrant termination and prior convictions will only be definite grounds for termination if the crimes were of a willfully violent nature and/or a sexual offense that is determined to be of a violent or predatory nature by a court of law.)
b) Repeated violation of the rules set forth in this corpora or the current version of the Amtgard Rules of Play.
c) Knowingly falsifying information on any official Amtgard document.
d) Theft of any Amtgard funds or property.
11.42 Temporary Suspensions
The Monarch and Prime Minister or GMR may enact a temporary suspension on any member deemed to be unsafe or a detriment to group function as per the Amtgard Rules of Play. This suspension shall not exceed one month without a vote from the Althing.
11.43 Termination and Suspension Procedures – For termination of any membership, or any suspension exceeding one month, all of the following conditions must be met pursuant to ORS 65.167:
a) A petition signed by 20% of all active dues paid members must be presented to the Monarchy stating the request and reasons for termination or suspension.
b) An Althing must then be scheduled to vote on the termination or suspension no less than 30 days and no more than 90 days after the petition is received. The vote must pass with a 2/3 majority of all dues paid members voting in attendance, by proxy, or by sealed ballot.
c) The member that is to be terminated or suspended must be notified by first class certified mail to the member's last known address, at least 15 days prior to the vote for removal/suspension. The letter must state the time, date and location that the vote will take place. The letter must also include the reasons for the termination or suspension and the length of time the suspension shall be in effect.
d) The member in question will be allowed an opportunity to speak in their own defense, in person or in writing; at the Althing the vote is to take place. Failure of the member in question to show up, in person or in writing, to the vote, will constitute the consent of the termination or suspension and the vote will automatically pass in favor of termination or suspension.
e) If the Prime Minister or GMR are the ones being suspended or terminated then they are not allowed to make decisions regarding their suspension or termination. If the Monarch is to be suspended or terminated then the president of the BoD shall preside over the Althing to vote on their suspension or termination.

d) A terminated member may petition the Althing once every 3 years, by sending a certified letter to the registered address of the corporation requesting an Althing hearing to have their membership reinstated.
e) Any member terminated in this fashion will be added to the Infraction Sheet as per section 11.1 of this corpora.
f) Notification regarding the termination of said member shall also be posted to the Circle of Monarchs official communication forum, for consideration by any bordering or otherwise affected Kingdoms.

b) A suspended member may be removed from all kingdom mailing lists, forums, publications and any other forms of kingdom media if the Althing deems it warranted.
c) A suspended member shall be barred from participating in any functions within the Kingdom, whether they are Kingdom level or holding level events.
d) A suspended member shall have all privileges which have been suspended (not revoked) reinstated the first day after the suspension has concluded. The length of said suspension shall be determined by the Monarch and Prime Minister or GMR and the Althing shall have the power to shorten or lengthen the sentence at the vote to suspend the member.
e) Any member suspended in this fashion will be added to the Infraction Sheet as per section 11.1 of this corpora.

Temporary Ruling:
I propose to change the term pro-tem to interim within the Monarch and Regent deceptions of the bylaws as well as define what the interim position is. It also adds to the Prime Minister description by adding in the interim position, as well as defines said position.
In 1.197 Change the word “pro-tem” to “interim”
In 1.197a Change the word “pro-tem” to “interim”
Add the following “1.197c The interim position will not count towards the individual’s term limits, nor will it count as fulfilling any requirements for awards.”
In 1.2D Change the words “pro-tem” to “interim”
In 1.2D1 Change the words “pro-tem” to “interim”
In 1.2D2 Change the words “pro-tem” to “interim”
Add the following “1.2D3 The interim position will not count towards the individual’s term limits, nor will it count as fulfilling any requirements for awards.”
In 1.3C add the words “to elect an interim Prime Minister”
In 1.3C replace the last sentence “All Prime Minister requirements must be met for the emergency election” with “All requirements to run for the position of Interim Prime Minister are the same as for Prime Minister”
Add the following “1.3C1 The interim position will not count towards the individual’s term limits, nor will it count as fulfilling any requirements for awards.”
YES VOTE: This will mean that the proper wording will be added for the purpose of interim positions. It specifically states that it doesn’t count against term limits and does not qualify them for any awards based of their term in the interim position.
NO VOTE: This will keep the bylaws as they are. The position of Prime Minister is never considered pro-tem and for the pro-tem positions of Monarch and Regent are not defined. They would still count against term limits and qualify them for awards of that position. This will affect the current elections.

11.524 Moderators may remove anyone from the Facebook group for repeated violation of the rules set forth in section 11.531 of the corpora. Moderators must follow removal procedures set forth in section 11.54.
11.525 Any Moderator who deliberately removes another moderator from the Kingdom Facebook group without their expressed consent shall be subject to removal from the Kingdom following the procedures set forth in section 11.43.
11.526 Any Moderator who violates section 11.531 may be subject to removal from the Facebook group by an Althing and may be removed from office if the offence is deemed severe enough. Any Moderator may delete another Moderator’s post if they are in violation of section 11.531.
11.53 Conduct
11.531 Unacceptable Behavior
Anything that would inherently hinder the performance and welfare of the people, the Kingdom, and Amtgard as a whole, including, but not limited to:
a) Malicious name-calling and Ad Hominem.
b) Bullying.
c) Threats.
d) Defamation.
11.532 Acceptable Behavior

a) Promotion of Amtgard activities.
b) Althing proposals and results.
c) Minutes of any Althing or BoD meetings.
d) Photographs and Video footage of events.
e) Any documents or web links that support the players and/or the Kingdom.
f) Promotion of Amtgard events.
g) Any other comments or posts that do not violate section 11.531.
11.54 Removal Procedures
11.541 Removal from the Kingdom Facebook page shall be done only by following each of these steps:
a) A minimum of three documented warnings issued by the moderators.
b) A 3/5 majority vote of all Moderators in favor of removal.
c) A private message shall be sent to the person being removed stating the reasons and the length for their removal.
11.542 It is the responsibility of the person who was removed to request to be added to the group once the term of their removal is over.
11.543 Any member of the Kingdom of Black Spire who has their membership terminated or suspended shall be immediately removed from the Facebook group as per sections 11.44b and 11.45b. Note that a suspended member may not need to be removed if the Althing did not deem it necessary.

Web Site Proposal Expanded Definition
Core Features of the CMS
Joomla is so much more than just a powerful content management system. Here is a list of features "out of the box," but the true power of Joomla is in its extensibility.
User Management
Joomla has a registration system that allows users to configure personal options. There are nine user groups with various types of permissions on what users are allowed to access, edit, publish and administrate.
Authentication is an important part of user management and Joomla support multiple protocols, including LDAP, OpenID, and even Gmail. This allows users to use their existing account information to streamline the registration process.
Media Manager
The Media Manager is the tool for easily managing media files or folders and you can configure the MIME type settings to handle any type of file. The Media Manager is integrated into the Article Editor tool so you can grab images and other files at any time.
Language Manager
There is international support for many world languages and UTF-8 encoding. If you need your Web site in one language and the administrator panel in another, multiple languages are possible.
Banner Management
It's easy to set up banners on your Web site using the Banner Manager, starting with creating a client profile. Once you add campaigns and as many banners as you need, you can set impression numbers, special URLs, and more.
Contact Management
The Contact Manager helps your users to find the right person and their contact information. It also supports multiple contact forms going to specific individuals as well as groups.
Polls
If you want to find out more about your users, it's easy to create polls with multiple options.
Search
Help navigate users to most popular search items and provide the admin with search statistics.
Web Link Management
Providing link resources for site users is simple and you can sort them into categories, even count every click.
Content Management
Joomla's simplified three-tiered system of articles makes organizing your content a snap. You can organize
your content any way you want and not necessarily how it will be on your Web site. Your users can rate articles, e-mail them to a friend, or automatically save a PDF (with UTF-8 support for all languages). Administrators can archive content for safekeeping, hiding it from site visitors.
On public Web sites, built-in e-mail cloaking protects email addresses from spambots.
Creating content is simple with the WYSIWYG editor, giving even novice users the ability to combine text, images in an attractive way. Once you've created your articles, there are a number of pre-installed modules to show the most popular articles, latest new items, newsflashes, related articles, and more.
Syndication and Newsfeed Management
With Joomla, it's easy to syndicate your site content, allowing your users to subscribe to new content in their favorite RSS reader. It's equally easy to integrate RSS feeds from other sources and aggregate them all on your site.
Menu Manager
The Menu Manager allows you to create as many menus and menu items as you need. You can structure your menu hierarchy (and nested menu items) completely independent of your content structure. Put one menu in multiple places and in any style you want; use rollovers, dropdown, flyouts and just about any other navigation system you can think of. Also automatic breadcrumbs are generated to help navigate your site users.
Template Management
Templates in Joomla are a powerful way to make your site look exactly the way you want and either use a single template for the entire site or a separate template for each site section. The level of visual control goes a step further with powerful template overrides, allowing you to customize each part of your pages.
Integrated Help System
Joomla has a built-in help section to assist users with finding what they need. A glossary explains the terms in plain English, a version checker makes sure you're using the latest version, a system information tool helps you troubleshoot, and, if all else fails, links to a wealth of online resources for additional help and support.
System Features
Speedy page loads are possible with page caching, granular-level module caching, and GZIP page compression.
If your system administrator needs to troubleshoot an issue, debugging mode and error reporting are invaluable.
The FTP Layer allows file operations (like installing Extensions) without having to make all the folders and files writable, making your site administrator's life easier and increasing the security of your site.
Administators quickly and efficiently communicate with users one-on-one through private messaging or all site users via the mass mailing system.
Web Services
With Web services, you can use Remote Procedure Calls (via HTTP and XML). You can also integrate XML-RPC services with the Blogger and Joomla APIs.
Powerful Extensibility
These are just some of the basic Joomla features and the real power is in the way you customize Joomla. Visit the Joomla Extensions Directory to see thousands of ways to enhance Joomla to suit your needs.
