Good evening populace of Black Spire. I come to bearing the results of the votes. I know many of you were on the edge of your seats waiting for the results. We had 39 votes total. I want to thank all of you who voted, I was pleased with this turn out. Now, if you did not specifically select "yes" or "no" your vote got counted as "Abstain" after running the numbers of those who did not select anything after voting for someone else, even if those had been "no" votes, the winners would not have changed.

Alright Black Spire here is your #bsalthing post from August 14th 2021.
We didn't have a video so here is a quick recap.
Theory started off the Althing by thanking everyone who came out. Rysa handed out physical awards for the things she's been giving awards to, throughout her A&S event.
Dragon Master was discussed, it will be at Dusk Hollow this weekend August 8/22/21. Entries must be in by 12:00pm. We're going to do our best to stick to this strict timing because Dragon Master traditionally pulls in more entries than other events and therefore takes longer to judge. There will be food. There will also be artisans taking commissions. We can't actually sell anything as that's against the park's rules however you can request a commission.
We also discussed Weaponmaster which will be held on 8/29/21. Big Mac has already posted about that, so I won't go into details on that. We will also be holding Elections that day. Please show up and vote. If you haven't gotten dues paid yet, please reach out to your local Chancellor. If you can't reach them, or you're having trouble, please let me know. Since Covid has flared up again and all, I will continue to take online votes, so you do NOT have to show up to vote. I will post a ballot online again, like I did for this last Althing.
That brings us to the Althing. Big Mac went over his proposal and then Akryn touched on his and then we ended the Althing so we could get on with the voting. Here are the results of that vote:
Proposal 1 allows Kingdom Regent to give out Warriors and Crowns.
16 Yes 1 No 2 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 2 allows Kingdom Champion to give our Smiths and Warriors
15 Yes 3 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 3 allows land Regents to give out Warriors and Crowns
17 Yes 1 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 4 allows land Champions to hand out Smiths and Warriors
15 Yes 3 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 5 allows allows Kingdom Regent to hand out Master Dragon, Garber, Lion, Owl, Rose, Smith, Warrior, Hydra and Reeve.
16 Yes 2 No 1 Abstain
Passes
Proposal 6 Big Mac's change to Weaponmaster
16 Yes 0 No 1 Abstain
Passes
(If you want details on what each of these changes looks like, please visit our files section)
As always, if you have any questions feel free to ask.
In service always,
Squire Overlord Falcon Moonsdotter your friendly neighborhood KPM

An Althing is held but results are not available on Facebook.
Ballot is posted as follows:

Althing Old Business. 2 items
Allthing proposal. #1
Research cost for NPO legal assistance.
Procedure: BoD President checks with no less than 3 NPO lawyers or legal firms to determine
cost for legal assistance in the Kingdom to operate as an NPO in Oregon/Washington.
Purpose: To ensure the Kingdom operates within legal requirements within Oregon and
Washington and the cost required to assist with legal standings.
The idea of this is to ensure our Corpora and operating procedures meet with both Oregon and
Washington law.
Reason for the BoD President to be directing this is because it deals with external agencies
which the Monarchy is not allowed to deal with unless approved by the BoD.
Yes______ (Yes this is something to look into)
No ______ (No this isn’t needed yet)
(Note: This is just for cost research and not an approval to hire a lawyer.)
Proposition for Allthing #2
Research and gather information about Microsoft 365 for use at the Kingdom level.
Action: BoD President, due to this being NPO related and dealing with the operation of the club,
uses the link attached to see if the Kingdom can benefit from and be given the program
Microsoft 365.
Reason: To assist in seamless transfer of positions and to reduce the loss of information
because of human.
Yes______ (Yes this is something to look into)
No ______ (No this isn’t needed)
(Note: This is just for cost research and not an approval to purchase.)

19 Jan 2019
On Saturday during the Allthing, two proposals were brought up by Sir Moonshine (Marc Jacob). They are as follows:
01/19/19
#1
Requesting funds of $500 for basic kingdom event materials and supplies. 
such as:
-2 plastic bins
-Med kits
-Walkie talkies 
-Supply's for gate (Sign in sheets, bracelets/wrist bands, clip boards, pens, paper, etc)
-Dragon master/ A&S Entry Forms 
-Award supplies. Need more copies of awards to be able to hand out at events.
These are the many basic items or supplies needed to help run the kingdom and campouts. I think it is time the kingdom starts actively investing in itself.
#2
On behalf of Operation Bling and our counted success and growth to promote the arts more with our courts, we are asking the kingdom to help fund some of our projects that is focused on our kingdom image.
We are asking for $150 to do this. It would include:
-Cloth for more table cloths in kingdom colors for high table
-Help contribute cost toward more kingdom banners.
Operation bling will also help fund money to help with this cause, but we will also need kingdom help.

Greetings, Blackspire!
With joint agreement between the Monarch, Prime Minister, and Kingdom Guildmaster of Reeves, the player known as Brotaku, or Racer X (Brandon Guffey) is suspended from all Amtgard events within the boundaries of Blackspire for six months.
This was announced at the Dragons Forge KLE, making the official starting date January 13th, 2019. This will end on July 13th, 2019.
This player has the right to appeal this decision if they so choose, and the date of said appeal will be announced as soon as it is asked for.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria of Blackspire

8 Sep 2018
With joint agreement between the Monarch and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Blackspire will be upholding this 3 month suspension on the player known as Lord Gannon.
As such, if Silvermoon repeals this suspension at their local appeal, We will, as well. (posted by the Queen)

Puff Voad
Kingdom of Blackspire Prime Minister

My good people of Blackspire! I’m extremely sorry for the very delayed update on the amounts in all of the Kingdoms accounts. There were some scheduling and mundane complications that prevented me from having the amount of access I needed to the bank in order to do this. But everything is fixed and ready to go.
In the main account there is $5,376.28
In the Pacwar account there is $4,100
In the Winterbash account there is $3,000
I have spent $261.63 in total to reimburse for things needed and used in the Dallas Parade. Things such as decorations, gas for the truck and pizza for all who showed up.
I will also be officially announcing all this at the next KLE.
Your KPM
Puff Voad

Good evening Blackspire!
Sorry for the late post! But!!!!!!! I have the results from the allthing vote at the Forgotten Glades KLE this last Saturday August 4th.
The votes went as follows.
On the vote to release funds for;
Winterbash - 15 yes, 0 no, 2 abstain
Pac-War - 15 yes, 0 no, 2 abstain
Vote to uphold the Eries suspension- 11 yes, 4 no, 2 abstain
So in conclusion, the release of funds for both events passed, and will begin the process of having all parties involved sign fiduciary contracts and release the funds that were stated at the allthing. 
The vote on whether or not to uphold Eries(Bethany Love) 6 week suspension has passed and is still in place.
Thank you to all who participated in the events or even just watched. Always makes for a good KLE. Hope everyone had a good weekend and rest of your week. See you all August 19th at my home park Obsidian Grove for elections.
Your friendly KPM
Puff Voad ??

Greetings, Blackspire.
We would like to make a couple of announcements, here.
Firstly, the Kingdom will be upholding Silvermoon's suspension of the player known as Kalahan (Andrew Martin), citing a violation of the Amtgard Code of Conduct section 6. This player will be indefinitely barred from all Amtgard activities within the borders of Blackspire, effective immediately. This indefinite suspension will be repealed if/when Silvermoon repeals their suspension.
We would also like to announce the temporary suspension of the player known as Eries Evol (Bethany Love). This suspension is in response to their retaliatory behavior towards another player. With joint agreement between the Queen and the Prime Minister, this player will be barred from all Amtgard activities within the borders of Blackspire for six weeks, effective immediately. As this infraction occurred online, this player will also be muted from the Blackspire Facebook group for the duration of the suspension. This player has the right to an appeal, as do all suspended members of Blackspire. Should they request it, this appeal would take place at the next available althing, currently slated at Crown Quals on August 4th.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria Veleno of Blackspire

Dallas Parade
For consideration and discussion at the next althing, I request that the pacwar funds for 2018 be released directly to me as the event runner. This will allow me to purchase things online and better manage the event without the complication of getting the prime minister to write out business checks directly to the businesses. As many businesses do not accept business checks this greatly reduces the effectiveness of planning an event and restricts the items I can purchase for the event. I promise to have a ledger and keep all receipts to be turned over within 2 weeks after the event. And available for all monarchy request. Its to override 11.4.9 "All expenditures for the event will be paid for by check(s) made out to the specific business(es) for services, goods, and fees outlined in the event bid" of the policies document.
If there are any questions, Please ask.
In service,
Squire Klepto


Good morning Blackspire,

Mystic Seas:
Yes-4
No-1
Abstain-0
Rising Moon 
Yes-4
No-0
Abstain-1

Puff Voad 
Kingdom Prime Minister


7 Jul 2018
Good morning people of Blackspire,
As of Saturday’s KLE at Iron Keep, the 6 month suspension of Maxamillion(David Zeller) stands and is still in place. With a vote of 8 yes and 1 abstain.
Kingdom Prime Minister 
Puff Voad


With agreement between the Queen and the Prime Minister, we are hereby suspending the player known as Celestia from all official Amtgard activities within the borders of the Kingdom of Blackspire for three months, effective immediately. This is in response to an incident that occurred at the inter-kingdom event Rosewood this weekend.
This player has the right to appeal the suspension, should she choose to do so, at which point all evidence will be brought to the next althing for the populace to vote on.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria Veleno of Blackspire


9 Jun 2018
With joint agreement between the Monarch, the Kingdom Prime Minister, and the Kingdom Guildmaster of Reeves, the player known as Maximilian (David Zeller) is hereby suspended from all Amtgard activity within the boundaries of the Kingdom of Blackspire for the next six months, effective immediately.
This action is being taken in response to both a formal report filed containing multiple statements about his behavior on the field and an incident at the kingdom sponsored event, Shattered Kingdoms, following him being asked to leave site.
We find him to be in violation of the Code of Conduct, sections 1, 5, and 6.
This player has the right to put in an althing proposal to defend himself and his actions and ask for the suspension to be repealed, and he may attend that althing in order to present his defense.
In service,
Queen Dee Metria Veleno of Blackspire

Holding Change:
Add the holding of Forgotten Glades be added to the Kingdom of Blackspire

Proposals from Sir Uriel
1.Change Constitution: 
12.2.1 Any award or title may be rescinded by a 3/4 majority of vote of active members at an Althing. 
To:
12.2.1 Any award or title may be rescinded by a 2/3 majority vote at a group membership meeting.
12.2.1.1  Only active dues paid members may vote on rescinding an award or title.
Reason:
Fixes confusing verbiage about needed percentage being from those voting or those dues paid.  Reduces needed percentage to ? which is more inline with removing officers.


2. Change Constitution:
14.3.5 The tournament brackets will be: 
14.3.5.1 Single short weapon. 
14.3.5.2 Double short weapon. 
14.3.5.3 Shield and weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.3.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.3.5.5 Open (contestant's choice). 
To:
14.3.5 The tournament brackets will be: 
14.3.5.1 Single short weapon. 
14.3.5.2 Double short weapon. 
14.3.5.3 Shield and short weapon. 
14.3.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.3.5.5 Open (contestant's choice of melee weapons and shields).
Reason:
Standardizes tournament brackets other than great and open as short melee weapons.  Which is more inline with how we have run this tournament.


3. Change Constitution:
14.5.4 The Weaponmaster tournament will be a multi-bracketed, single elimination tournament. 14.5.5 The brackets must include: 
14.5.5.1 Single one-handed weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.5.5.2 Double weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.5.5.3 Shield and weapon (any melee weapon). 
14.5.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.5.5.5 Open (contestant's choice). 
14.5.6 At the Guildmaster of Reeves' discretion, the "Single one-handed weapon bracket" may be replaced by two separate "Single short weapon" and "Single long weapon" brackets. If this is not done, long weapons shall be allowed in the bracket. 
14.5.7 Other brackets may be included at the discretion of the Guildmaster of Reeves. Possibilities include:
14.5.7.1 Bow. 
14.5.7.2 Dagger (single or double). 
14.5.7.3 Flail. 
14.5.7.4 Thrown weapon.
14.5.8 Specific rules and bracket selection for the Weaponmaster Tourney must be posted at least two weeks prior to the date set forth for the Tournament.
To:
14.5.4 The Weaponmaster tournament will be a multi-bracketed, single elimination tournament. 
14.5.4.1 A different tournament format may be use at the discretion of the Guildmaster of Reeves.
14.5.5 The brackets must include: 
14.5.5.1 Single short weapon.
14.5.5.2 Double short weapon.  
14.5.5.3 Shield and short weapon. 
14.5.5.4 Great weapon. 
14.5.5.5 Open (contestant's choice of melee weapons and shields).

14.5.7.1 Single long weapon.

14.5.7.4 Thrown weapon.
14.5.8 Specific rules and bracket selection for the Weaponmaster Tourney must be posted at least two weeks prior to the date set forth for the Tournament.
Reason:
Sets the standard to short melee weapon for brackets that are traditionally that on often set as that.  Allows tournament organizer more freedom with tournament style.

4. Change Constitution:
14.5 Weaponmaster Tournament 
14.5.1 Shall be held on the same day as elections for Monarch and Regent, or within the next two weeks of that date.
To:
14.5 Weaponmaster Tournament 
14.5.1 Shall be held once a reign either on the same day as elections for Monarch and Regent or the same day as elections for Prime Minister, or within the next two weeks of one of those dates.
Reason:
Allows the Monarch flexibility when building a schedule.  Still assures the Weapons Master is held but allows it to be held around midreign should that fit better with the reigns schedule.

5. Add Constitution:
14.7 Dragonmaster
14.7.1 Shall be held once a reign.
14.7.2 The sponsor for this event will be the Regent.
14.7.2.1 The regent my appoint someone else to run the event.
14.7.2 The winner will hold the title of Dragonmaster until the date of the next Dragonmaster.

14.7.6 Specific rules for Dragonmaster shall be put out by the sponsor at least six weeks prior to the scheduled date of the Dragonmaster.

Change Constitution:

15.17.6.2 Holdings may hold their own versions of Warmaster and Weaponmaster tournaments but the winners of these events are not granted the title of Warmaster or Weaponmaster.

To:
15.17.6.2 Holdings may hold their own versions of Warmaster, Weaponmaster, and Dragonmaster  tournaments but the winners of these events are not granted the title of Warmaster, Weaponmaster, or Dragonmater.


Change Constitution:

13.20 Weaponmaster 
13.21 Warmaster 
13.22 Guildmaster of an Arts and Sciences Guild 
13.23 Guildmaster of a Class Guild

To:
13.20 Weaponmaster 
13.21 Warmaster 
13.22 Dragonmaster
13.23 Guildmaster of an Arts and Sciences Guild

Proposal from Pungkow

On June 11, 2016 a proposal was voted in that would allow $500 from the profit of PacWar to be added to the PacWar account. Because there was no profit made from PacWar, inflation, and that bids for PacWar are requiring more funds for the site fee, it is proposed that $500.00 worth of general funds are allocated into the PacWar account for use. It also states in the policies that the account is supposed to have this amount ($2500.00). The current amount in the PacWar account is $2000.25.

11.5.2 A minimum balance of $2500 shall be maintained in the PacWar account. 

Voting:
Yes: A vote of yes for this proposal would transfer $500.00 from the general fund ($3128.43 balance) to the PacWar account ($2000.25 balance) to raise the minimum amount to $2500.00.

No: A vote of no for this proposal would keep the balance of the PacWar account the same.

Proposals from Ceian
1) The first is that I am bringing forward the proposal to change our corpora from the current version to the drafts the BOD has been working on for the past year and a half. Due to clauses in the event related sections of the corpora locking them down to require a 2/3 vote to edit, a proposal to change the corpora wholesale will also require a 2/3 majority vote to pass (since those sections would be changed).
This one is to replace the corpora with a rewrite that divides the document into three sections:
one that is our actual legally binding bylaws
one that is out-of-game mundane policies
one that covers game / roleplay based matters such as the awards system
This rewrite also adds a section explicitly detailing rules for how holdings should run in order to meet the kingdom's standards. They're pretty loose, were written to reflect reality, and shouldn't be telling you to do anything you weren't already doing. 
This is not a new corpora written from scratch. This is the existing Blackspire corpora, reorganized into three sections, with details on holding affairs added. There may be a few relatively minor changes here and there but overall the BOD's mandate on this project was NOT to give the kingdom a new, better corpora, it was partition the existing corpora into separate sections.
2) The second is that I am bringing forward a sub-proposal, should the corpora rewrite proposal not pass, to add a clause to the current corpora authorizing the Monarch to sign contracts and enter into legal agreements on behalf of the organization. Amtgard International will be asking us to sign a contract with them agreeing to their terms in exchange for use of the Amtgard name. Our current bylaws don't give any authorization to anyone to enter our organization into contracts
And one more piece of new Althing business. Corpora edit proposal (edit to the current corpora).
ADD:
1.199 Has the authority to sign contracts binding the group that have been approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors.
This gives the monarch the authority to sign contracts. I'm introducing it as a proposal at the same time as the corpora rewrite proposal just in case the corpora rewrite proposal fails. We (the kingdom) need to sign a new contract with Amtgard International. Our current bylaws don't give anyone the authority to do that. The rewritten bylaws do, but in case we don't adopt them, this proposal would patch the current bylaws so that that contract can be signed.
Sir Baelnorn’s proposal
3) Proposal: Allow Shattered Kingdoms to create its own legal NPO.
Yes Vote: Shattered Kingdoms would register with the state, retain its funds and legal rights to the world of Shattered Kingdoms.
No Vote: Shattered Kingdoms would release its funds to the kingdom’s general fund.
What would this mean? 
This would mean that Shattered Kingdoms would register as a non-profit business, just like Black Spire and retain funds from gate fees, auctions and fundraisers, all of which would be used to better Shattered Kingdoms events. Shattered Kingdoms would make financial information available upon request within a reasonable amount of time. We would also endeavor to make sure we continued to be sanctioned by an Amtgard group to continue to be an amtgard event.
Why keep it separate from Black Spire? 
Unlike Winterbash and PacWar Shattered Kingdoms has not been ran by Black Spire. Shattered Kingdoms is the creation of Josh Miller (Baelnorn), Brian Ogilvie (Vincent) and Kim Dietz (Kai Soulful) and is not a bid based system and there are no intentions of it ever being such. The creative and organizational control isn’t tied to Black Spire. Additionally there are intellectual concerns. The world of Shattered Kingdoms was never intended to be owned by Black Spire and I, Josh Miller, would like the rights to the world of Shattered Kingdoms to be tied to its own NPO. The fact that the event has been the kingdom’s mid-reign was an added bonus but is not the purpose for Shattered Kingdoms.

Pacwar proposal passed 18 - 0
Blackspire althing proposal 6/11/16
Please fill in the bubble next to your vote.  If you are proxy voting on behalf of someone else, please fill in their information as well as yours in the space indicated below.


For the distribution of funds in regards to Pacific War: Armageddon (being held September 2016). We propose the following.

The first $2,000 made from the event will be used to replenish the Pac War fund, as currently is stated in the copora.

In the event that not enough is made by PacWar(gate entry sales, fundraisers) to fully repay Northern Lights and Black SPire contributions, the amount left will be split evenly between both groups.  In no situation will any Kingdom be owed money by PacWar, other than what the event itself brings in.

Any third parties who needed to put money in will be reimbursed.  In the event not enough proceeds are left after repayment of PacWar fund and the Kingdoms, this money is just a loss and will not be owed to any third parties.

All money left after reimbursement on the reimbursement schedule will be considered profit.

Profit will be divided as follows.

The first $500 profit will be allocated to the Pac War find.  In recognition of raising costs of reserving sites place the need of a fund to be enlarged.

All profit after that will be a split according to kingdom investment.

(Example 1 - If Blackspire and Northern Lights both invest $2000, remaining profits would be split 50/50).

(Example 2 - If Blackspire invested $2000 and Northern Lights invested $500, remaining profits would be split 80/20).

This constitutes distribution of profits based on investment.”

Let us continue to discuss but this current rework should satisfy the things I’ve seen brought up so far (enlarging Pac War fund, making sure Pac War fund is replenished first).

	O	No

The Freehold Forest of Fado has requested to join The Kingdom of Blackspire.
Tyrant Ceian has requested $500 dollar for the express purpose of having the re-written copora looked at by a lawyer.  Any of the $500 not spent on this legal fee will be returned to the kingdom.

Sir Blade brought forward the point that as worded, the proposal leaves open the possibility for Northern Lights to indebt Blackspire if it contributes an amount large enough, and the event loses an amount of money large enough, that they can't be reimbursed from the gross. He requested additional safeguards be added against this in the proposal. Based on his commentary, Duke Kalzar tabled his proposal until the next Althing to be further rewritten.

Ceian gave a speech about the current status of the Rules Revision process and encouraged the populace to make their will known if they would like to see things go differently from their current course.

Pacwar funding proposal by Sir Tseng and Duke Kalzar
For the distribution of funds occurring in regards to Pacific War: Armageddon (being held September 2016), we propose the following.

The first $2,000 made from the event will be used to replenish the Pac War fund, as currently is stated in the corpora.

Proceeds will then be split evenly until investments from both Black Spire (outside of the Pac War fund) and Northern Lights are recouped.

Following this any third parties who needed to put money in will be reimbursed.

All money left after reimbursements on the reimbursement schedule will be considered profit.

Profit will be divided as follows.

The first $500 profit will be allocated to the Pac War fund. In recognition of raising costs of reserving sites place the need of a fund to be enlarged.

All profits after that will be a split percentage according to kingdom investment.

(Example 1 - If Blackspire and Northern Lights both invest $2000, remaining profits would be split 50/50).

(Example 2 - If Blackspire invested $2000 and Northern Lights invested $500, remaining profits would be split 80/20).

(Compiler’s note: Minutes were unavailable. The following corpora amendment proposal, submitted by Sir Moonshine, was found and to the best of the compiler’s recollection passed a vote on Althing at this date.)
Temporary Ruling:
I propose to change the term pro-tem to interim within the Monarch and Regent deceptions of the bylaws as well as define what the interim position is. It also adds to the Prime Minister description by adding in the interim position, as well as defines said position.
In 1.197 Change the word “pro-tem” to “interim”
In 1.197a Change the word “pro-tem” to “interim”
Add the following “1.197c The interim position will not count towards the individual’s term limits, nor will it count as fulfilling any requirements for awards.”
In 1.2D Change the words “pro-tem” to “interim”
In 1.2D1 Change the words “pro-tem” to “interim”
In 1.2D2 Change the words “pro-tem” to “interim”
Add the following “1.2D3 The interim position will not count towards the individual’s term limits, nor will it count as fulfilling any requirements for awards.”
In 1.3C add the words “to elect an interim Prime Minister”
In 1.3C replace the last sentence “All Prime Minister requirements must be met for the emergency election” with “All requirements to run for the position of Interim Prime Minister are the same as for Prime Minister”
Add the following “1.3C1 The interim position will not count towards the individual’s term limits, nor will it count as fulfilling any requirements for awards.”
YES VOTE: This will mean that the proper wording will be added for the purpose of interim positions. It specifically states that it doesn’t count against term limits and does not qualify them for any awards based of their term in the interim position.
NO VOTE: This will keep the bylaws as they are. The position of Prime Minister is never considered pro-tem and for the pro-tem positions of Monarch and Regent are not defined. They would still count against term limits and qualify them for awards of that position. This will affect the current elections.

11.525 Any Moderator who deliberately removes another moderator from the Kingdom Facebook group without their expressed consent shall be subject to removal from the Kingdom following the procedures set forth in section 11.43.

Web Site Proposal Expanded Definition
Core Features of the CMS
Joomla is so much more than just a powerful content management system. Here is a list of features "out of the box," but the true power of Joomla is in its extensibility.
User Management
Joomla has a registration system that allows users to configure personal options. There are nine user groups with various types of permissions on what users are allowed to access, edit, publish and administrate.
Authentication is an important part of user management and Joomla support multiple protocols, including LDAP, OpenID, and even Gmail. This allows users to use their existing account information to streamline the registration process.
Media Manager
The Media Manager is the tool for easily managing media files or folders and you can configure the MIME type settings to handle any type of file. The Media Manager is integrated into the Article Editor tool so you can grab images and other files at any time.
Language Manager
There is international support for many world languages and UTF-8 encoding. If you need your Web site in one language and the administrator panel in another, multiple languages are possible.
Banner Management
It's easy to set up banners on your Web site using the Banner Manager, starting with creating a client profile. Once you add campaigns and as many banners as you need, you can set impression numbers, special URLs, and more.
Contact Management
The Contact Manager helps your users to find the right person and their contact information. It also supports multiple contact forms going to specific individuals as well as groups.
Polls
If you want to find out more about your users, it's easy to create polls with multiple options.
Search
Help navigate users to most popular search items and provide the admin with search statistics.
Web Link Management
Providing link resources for site users is simple and you can sort them into categories, even count every click.
Content Management
Joomla's simplified three-tiered system of articles makes organizing your content a snap. You can organize
your content any way you want and not necessarily how it will be on your Web site. Your users can rate articles, e-mail them to a friend, or automatically save a PDF (with UTF-8 support for all languages). Administrators can archive content for safekeeping, hiding it from site visitors.
On public Web sites, built-in e-mail cloaking protects email addresses from spambots.
Creating content is simple with the WYSIWYG editor, giving even novice users the ability to combine text, images in an attractive way. Once you've created your articles, there are a number of pre-installed modules to show the most popular articles, latest new items, newsflashes, related articles, and more.
Syndication and Newsfeed Management
With Joomla, it's easy to syndicate your site content, allowing your users to subscribe to new content in their favorite RSS reader. It's equally easy to integrate RSS feeds from other sources and aggregate them all on your site.
Menu Manager
The Menu Manager allows you to create as many menus and menu items as you need. You can structure your menu hierarchy (and nested menu items) completely independent of your content structure. Put one menu in multiple places and in any style you want; use rollovers, dropdown, flyouts and just about any other navigation system you can think of. Also automatic breadcrumbs are generated to help navigate your site users.
Template Management
Templates in Joomla are a powerful way to make your site look exactly the way you want and either use a single template for the entire site or a separate template for each site section. The level of visual control goes a step further with powerful template overrides, allowing you to customize each part of your pages.
Integrated Help System
Joomla has a built-in help section to assist users with finding what they need. A glossary explains the terms in plain English, a version checker makes sure you're using the latest version, a system information tool helps you troubleshoot, and, if all else fails, links to a wealth of online resources for additional help and support.
System Features
Speedy page loads are possible with page caching, granular-level module caching, and GZIP page compression.
If your system administrator needs to troubleshoot an issue, debugging mode and error reporting are invaluable.
The FTP Layer allows file operations (like installing Extensions) without having to make all the folders and files writable, making your site administrator's life easier and increasing the security of your site.
Administators quickly and efficiently communicate with users one-on-one through private messaging or all site users via the mass mailing system.
Web Services
With Web services, you can use Remote Procedure Calls (via HTTP and XML). You can also integrate XML-RPC services with the Blogger and Joomla APIs.
Powerful Extensibility
These are just some of the basic Joomla features and the real power is in the way you customize Joomla. Visit the Joomla Extensions Directory to see thousands of ways to enhance Joomla to suit your needs.
